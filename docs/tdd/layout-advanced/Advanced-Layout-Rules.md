# Advanced Layout Rules

## Column Balancing
- For multi-column sections, balance columns on section end.
- If explicit column breaks present, do not rebalance.

## Keep Together
- keepTogether on paragraph prevents split across pages.
- If too large to fit, allow split with warning.

## Keep With Next
- keepWithNext keeps consecutive blocks on same page.

## Widow/Orphan
- Min lines at top/bottom of page (default 2).
- Adjust line breaks to satisfy constraints.

## Hyphenation Controls
- Manual hyphenation overrides automatic.
- Hyphenation zone can limit break points.

## Layout Compatibility
- If document has compatibility flags, follow Word 2007+ behavior.
